<h1>Athena</h1>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
Athena provides EFSM inference, including inference of both guard and update functions. 
Guard inference is performed by third-party tools (currently that developed by <a href="http://www2.le.ac.uk/departments/computer-science/people/neil-walkinshaw">N. Walkinshaw</a>). Update inference is provided by the Athena update inference module.
